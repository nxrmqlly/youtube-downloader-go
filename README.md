# youtube-downloader-go

## About

A small Go based application that downloads YouTube videos with a simple UI.
Uses Wails to link the Svelte frontend to the Go backend.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on <http://localhost:34115>. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
